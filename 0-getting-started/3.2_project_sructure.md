# Project Structure

public folder should contain files that will be displayed on the client, the most important file is the index.html.

The src folder should contian all of the JavaScript, Css and image files that will be compiled into a bundle and injected into index.html So that Webpack can find them.

## How is React compiled into a  bundle file?

- It uses a "file loader". In the case of Creat React App, Webpack is used.

- Webpack creates a bundle file containing the content of multiple files tha need to be bundled together and it is all added together into a single file.
- Instead of making the HTML file go and fins the multiple files, which can slow down load times tremendously, it only has to find one file. (SPA).
