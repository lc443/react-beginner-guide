# REACT

- a Facebook JS library, not framework for front end web apps.
- Advantages:
  - <b>Speed</b>
    - Interractive websites need to update the DOM each time a change happens; this process is generally resourceful and slow.
    - React uses a Virtual DOM (Document Object Model), allowing to update only the parts of the website that have changed. This increases the speed of updates dramatically, as modern web applications may contain thousands of elements.

  - <b>Ease of Use</b>
    - React allows developers to group related code together, thereby making building and maintaining large scale applications much less complex.

  - <b>Support</b>
    - React has an amazingly large community and is open source. It is maintianed by Facebook and the community.
