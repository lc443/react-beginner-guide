## Create React App

Besides adding react to a website, which was very basig, we can create real web apps with it. Apps that contain multiple files and use 3rd party libraries.

Facebook create something called <a src=""create-react-app.dev> Create React App</a> that makes it easy to setup a react project with just a simple command.
 
 ```javascript
    npx create-react-app my-app
    cd my-app
    npm start
```
This will install all the requiered dependencies, configure and start the project on localhost:3000
