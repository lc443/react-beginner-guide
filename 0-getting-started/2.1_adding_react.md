## Adding React

React can be added to a website without any special tools and installations. First we need to add the React library as two script tags to the head of our HTML document.

    ``` 
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin
    ></script>

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin
    ></script>
    ```

Next we need to add another script, to enable the use of JSX. JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript, and it is recommended to be used with React.

    ```js
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js"></scipt>   
    ``` 

This approach is only suitable for small demo. We will create real react apps later.

After adding the required script tags, we can start building our React app!
We add a container that will be used to display something using React.

    ```js
        <div id="container"></div>
    ```

Now it is time for our first React code!
let's display a message as a heading

    ```js
    <script type="text/babel">
    ReactDOM.render(
        <h2>Hello World!</h1>,
        document.getElementById("container")
    )
    </script>
    ```
The code finds the container div and adds the h1 to it.
