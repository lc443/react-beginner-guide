# Props

Functional Components can accept arguments, similar to JavaScript functions. These arguments are called ``props``, and represent an object. Props are read only which means that components cannot modiy their props In our last example, we can use props like this.

```javascript
function Hello(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

Now we can add a name attribute to our element

```javascript
const el = <Hello name ="John"/>;
```

the attribute value will be passed to the component when rendered.
an element can have multiple custom attributes, which will be passed to the component when using the props object. You can use any custom names for you rattributes.

## Components Using Components

Components can use other Components to generate output.

```javascript
function App() {
    return <div>
            <Hello name="David"/>
            <Hello name="James"/>
            <Hello name="Amy"/>
            </div>
}
```

Here in our App component uses the Hello component three times, each time with a new name attribute.



## Props in Class Components

Props can be accessed in class components using ``this.props``

``` jsx

 class Hello extends React.Component {
     render () {
         return <p>Hello, {this.props.name}</p>;
     }
}
```

### Exercise: Shopping List

``` javascript
<Item name ="Cheese" price="4.99"/>

function Item(props) {
    return <div className="item">
    <b>Name:</b> {props.name} <br/>
    <b>Price:</b> {props.price} <br/>
    </div>
}
```

Now we can use our component to create multiple items for our shopping list

``` jsx

    <Item name ="Cheese" price="4.99"/>
    <Item name="Bread" price="1.5"/>
    <Item name="Ice Cream" price="24"/>

```

## State

Many web applications need their components to change their data, for example, after user interaction, (clicking a button, submitting a form etc.) Pops cannot do that since they are only. 

In order to allow components to manage and chane their data, React provides a feature called ``state``.

``State``  is an object that is added as a property in class components. It is a simple object that contains key:value pairs.

Components that have ``state`` are called stateful and ons without ``state`` are called stateless.

```jsx 
class Hello extends React.Component {
    state = {
        name: "james"
    }
    render() {
        return <h1>Hello, {this.state.name} </h1>
    }
}

```

## Changing State

``State`` should not be modified directly. Instead, React provides a ``setState()`` method, that can be used to modify state.

```jsx
this.setState({
    name: "James",
    age: 25
});
```
You need to pass an object with the new key:value pairs to the ``setState`` method. When ``setState`` is called, React automatically re-renders the affected component with the new state. The change in state happens in event handlers. 

## Example: counter app

```jsx
class Counter extends React.Component {
    state = {
        counter: 0
    }

    render() {
        return <div>
        <p>{this.state.counter}</p>
        <button>Increment</button>
        </div>
    }
}
```

```jsx
class Counter extends React.Component {
    state = {
        counter: 0
    }

    increment = () => {
        this.setState({
            counter:  this.state.counter+1
        });
    }

    render() {
        return <div>
        <p>{this.state.counter}</p>
        <button onClick={this.increment}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    }
}
```
