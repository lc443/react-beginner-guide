# Intro to React

## What is JSX?

    A syntax extension to JavaScript. It allows you to build UI element in JavaScript code. React does not require using JSX, but it is a common practice in the React community. It eases the development of user interfaces, as well as allows react to show useful error and warning messages

``` javascript
    var hello = <h1>Hello There</h1>
```

### Intro to JSX

```javascript

    React.DOM.render(
    <h1>Hello World</h1>,
    document.getElementById('root');
    );
```

    The code calls Reatc's render method, and passes it two arguments, a JSX element and a container. The render method displays the provider elements in tje contamer, which, in our cases is the HTML element with id="root"
    When you call the render method, any existing content of the container gets replaced. That is why, usually, the containers are empty in the HTML.

#### Expressions in JSX

    We can use any JavaScript expressions insie JSX using curly braces.
    Ex:

```javascript
    
        const name = "David";
        const salutation = <p>Hello, {name}</p>

        ReactDOM.render(
            salutation,
            document.getElementById('root');
        );
```

#### Attributes in JSX

    We can use attributes in JavaScript just like we did in Html

```jsx 
     <div id={user.id}></div>
```

    ReactDOM uses camelCase  property naming conversion nstead of HTML attribute name.
    Ex:


```jsx
        const y = "myClass";
        const class = <div cassName={x}></div>
```
