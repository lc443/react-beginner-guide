# Components

Components let you split the page into independent and reusable parts.
Separation of concerns is a programming principle that states that each concern shoul dbe sparated into individual pieces. There are 2 types of components you can use in React. ``Class Components`` and ``Functional Components``

## Functional Components

A functional component is a simple JavaScript function. The function name in a functional component begins with a capital letter. If it starts with lower case, the browser will treat it like a regular HTML element instead of a component.

```javascript
    function Hello() {
        return <h1>Hello World</h1>;
    }
```

### Rendering a Component

``` javascript

function Hello() {
        return <h1>Hello World</h1>;
    }
    const variable = <Hello/>;
    ReactDOM.render(
        variable, 
        document.getElementById('root');
    );
    }

```

## Class Components

Class components are typically used when there are more advanced user interactions, like forms and animations. All Class components need to extend the React.Component class. And need to have the render method which is in chare of telling the page what to show. So we can rewrite our Hello functional component as a class component like this

```javascript
        class Hello extends React.Component {
            render() {
                return <h1> Hello world</h1>
            }
        }
 ```
