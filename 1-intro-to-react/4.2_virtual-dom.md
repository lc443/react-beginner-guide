# How does JSX Work?

When the JSX expressions are compiled, they are converted into JavaScript objects, representing React elements. React then uses these elements to build the corresponding HTML DOM and dislay it in the browser.

```javascript
let counter = 0;

function show() {
    counter++;
    const variable =<p>{counter}</p>;
    ReactDOM.render(
       variable, document.getElementById('root');
    );
}

setInterval(show, 1000);

```

## Virtual DOM

React uses a Virtual DOM which is a lightweight representation of the DOM. When an element gets changed, it is first updated in the Virtual DOM. That process is fast, as the virtual EOM is represented by simple objects.

After that, React compres the Virtual DOM to its previous state and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.
